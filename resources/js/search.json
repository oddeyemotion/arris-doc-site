[[{"l":"Preface","p":["This is an alert I leave here for fun","This website was created by Arris(myself) as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my projects related to both Computer Science and Robotics.","I really hope I could get an internship somewhere in the industry :<"]},{"l":"Site development","p":["The site was generated with Retype- a text-based static website generator. All pages was written in Markdown. This really helps optimizing my time to focus on the detail rather than desperately trying to develop everything from scratch.","My best regards to the developers for such a free-of-charge yet so useful and really easy to use tool."]},{"l":"Indexing structure","p":["You might notice the way I organize the pages - each has its own unique ID number. This method is called Johnny.Decimal. It is a simple yet effective way to keep everything in control."]}],[{"l":"About me","p":["Xin chào! This is Arris. I am a university student based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I got a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation, so for now, please refer to me by that."]},{"l":"Fields of interest","p":["Currently, I am working towards my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.","Despite being from (in my opinion) one of the most heavily theoretical major, I found out that I perform better in tasks that require lots of physical practice.","And that, basically, is the main reason for my passion with another field of study - Robotics.","I spent most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. (Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)","My hobbies, on the other hand, are pretty artistic: I like drawing/painting, digital music making and dancing. I will write some more about these in the near future!"]},{"l":"Positive and not-so-positive aspects"},{"l":"What I am capable of","p":["I've had tons of experiences working in groups as the leader and in teams as the team captain. (I am in fact older than almost every student I met so probably because of my age...)","I control my temper very well and perform thoroughly under pressure.","When a new problem arises, I do my research and come up with the solution in a relatively short time."]},{"l":"Something to concern about me","p":["I was diagnosed with ADHD in early 2023 and am actively in professional medical treatment. While overall functioning of my brain has improved since then, I still have to deal with the symptoms at every moment (only they are much easier to control) combining with side effects from my medication. Some of these characteristics are:","Time blindness.","Unable to figure out any detail when looking at multiple different objects/text squeezed in the same small area. This may triggers my anxiety for some time.","Relative to the above: Unable to process if I was forced to listen to multiple sounds from different sources. However, I can distinguish sounds if they come from one source only (such as a recorded audio file).","Extreme dehydration.","Random unintentional pondering sessions."]},{"l":"Technical skills","p":["updating..."]}],[{"l":"Contact and Emailing"},{"l":"Email","p":["Hang Thi-Thuy Le hang.le2911@hcmut.edu.vn"]},{"i":"social-medias-forums","l":"Social medias & forums","p":["⠀Facebook - Hằng Lê⠀Github - oddeyemotion"]}],[{"i":"a03projects","l":"A03⠀Projects","p":["This is the navigation page for the list of projects I have worked on."]}],[{"i":"p04submarine","l":"P04⠀Submarine","p":["Submarine","P04.10 ⠀Index P04.11 ⠀About Submarine P04.12 ⠀License P04.13 ⠀Contact and emailing P04.14 ⠀Other sites","20 ⠀Target 21 ⠀Schedules & timestamps 22 ⠀Costs 23 ⠀Resources 24 ⠀Risk management 25 ⠀Communication 26 ⠀Meeting logs","30 ⠀The design 31 ⠀Tools & materials 32 ⠀Hardware implementation 33 ⠀Software implementation 34 ⠀Testing 35 ⠀Performance 36 ⠀Optimization 37 ⠀Public archive"]}],[{"i":"0410index","l":"04.10⠀Index","p":["10 ⠀Index 11 ⠀About Submarine 12 ⠀License 13 ⠀Contact and emailing 14 ⠀Other sites","20 ⠀Target 21 ⠀Schedules & timestamps 22 ⠀Costs 23 ⠀Resources 24 ⠀Risk management 25 ⠀Communication 26 ⠀Meeting logs","30 ⠀The design 31 ⠀Tools & materials 32 ⠀Hardware implementation 33 ⠀Software implementation 34 ⠀Testing 35 ⠀Performance 36 ⠀Optimization 37 ⠀Public archive"]}]]
