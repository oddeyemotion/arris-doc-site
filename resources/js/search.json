I am a student of Computer Science based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I saw a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation so for now please refer to me by that."]},{"l":"Fields of interest","p":["Despite being a student from (in my opinion) one of the most heavily theoretical major, I found out that I perform better in tasks that require lots of physical practice. And that, basically, is the main reason for my passion with another field of study - robotics. I spent most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. (Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)"]}],[{"l":"Contact and Emailing"},{"l":"Email","p":["Hang Le Thi Thuy hang.le2911@hcmut.edu.vn"]},{"i":"social-medias-forums","l":"Social medias & forums","p":["⠀Facebook - Hằng Lê⠀Github - oddeyemotion"]}],[{"l":"Index","p":["10 ⠀Index 11 ⠀About Submarine 12 ⠀License 13 ⠀Contact and emailing 14 ⠀Other sites","20 ⠀Target 21 ⠀Schedules & timestamps 22 ⠀Costs 23 ⠀Resources 24 ⠀Risk management 25 ⠀Communication 26 ⠀Meeting logs","30 ⠀The design 31 ⠀Tools & materials 32 ⠀Hardware implementation 33 ⠀Software implementation 34 ⠀Testing 35 ⠀Performance 36 ⠀Optimization 37 ⠀Public archive"]}]]
