And that was basically the main reason why my passion for another field of study was sparked - Robotics.","I have been spending most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. (Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)","Entries about my projects are available here. I will make sure the documents are as detailed as possible.","I am also working as a spare-time artist under the alias \"K\".

While overall functioning of my brain has improved since then, I still have to deal with the symptoms at every moment (only they are much easier to control) combining with side effects from my medication. Some of these characteristics are:","Time blindness.","Unable to figure out any detail when looking at multiple different objects/text squeezed in the same small area. This may triggers my anxiety for some time.","Relative to the above: Unable to process if I was forced to listen to multiple sounds from different sources. However, I can distinguish sounds if they come from one source only (such as a recorded audio file).","Extreme dehydration.","Random unintentional pondering sessions."]},{"l":"Technical skills","p":["Programming languages: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript Communication: Vietnamese, English, Polish, Cantonese Softwares: Autodesk Fusion 360, KiCAD, etc","More details in future updates"]},{"l":"Miscellaneous","p":["Despite my overall image, I am a longtime Hip-hop listener.

The boards are programmable using the Arduino IDE.","Our robot was constructed in a 7-week period regarding MERC 2023 tournament.
