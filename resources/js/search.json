When compelled to contend with various distractions, it is way too challenging to follow all the bouncing balls in a procedure to be able to extract the most salient information.","For individuals with cognitive disorders, documentation is an essential tool to optimize future engineering projects. Relying solely on memory to get work done can lead to forgetting important steps, such as creating backup files or editing certain points. Through thorough documentation of the process, it becomes easy to refer back and avoid getting lost or distracted. By providing a guide, one can follow the instructions to ensure consistent and predictable outcomes every time. This not only saves time and prevents frustration, but also provides a clear record of what has been done, which is beneficial for revisiting a project later or handing it off to someone else. Proper documentation also enables identification of areas for improvement and refining the process over time with confidence.","Overall, maintaining the habit of recapitulate everything in as much detail as possible helps ensure expectations, promotes uniformity, and provides a legacy. Therefore, lead to more successful and efficient projects."]},{"l":"Site development","p":["The site was generated with Retype- a text-based static website generator. All pages was written in Markdown. This really helps optimizing my time to focus on the detail rather than desperately trying to develop everything from scratch.

I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors.

We found that the circumferential difference between the 65mm tractor wheels (the remaining wheels at the back) and the 48mm or 58mm omni wheels was too large and critical. This is because when the tractor wheels complete a full rotation, the omni wheels have already rotated more than once.","In an effort to find a more suitable solution, we discovered open-source STL files for DIY 65mm omni wheels online. The majority of the components can be 3D printed, with the exception of some steel rods required to create the center poles for each of the omni wheel rollers, and heat shrink tubing to cover the rollers. Due to the design's advantages and ease of construction, we decided to manufacture a test version on our 3D printer.","More info about this test version will be available at Version archive in future updates","Upon inspection of the test version, we determined that the diameter of our newly-made omni wheel was still smaller than the tractor wheels. The tractor wheels were actually around 66 to 67mm in diameter, while our omni wheel was around 62mm(including the rollers, which were covered). As a result, we had to redesign the omni wheel assembly files from scratch, using the provided STL files as a guide. We used Fusion 360 to create the CAD files.","Recalculated version based on original design. Outer circle (the largest) is 66mm in diameter.","We produced new omni wheels with the new files and their diameters fit really close to the tractor wheels' diameters.","The customized omni wheels enabled us to operate our robot car smoothly and without any car bumps.
