[[{"l":"Preface","p":["Update on May 20th, 2023: Currently deploying entries for Submarine project.","This website was created by Arris(myself) as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my projects related to both Computer Science and Robotics.","I really hope I could get an internship somewhere in the industry :<"]},{"l":"Site development","p":["The site was generated with Retype- a text-based static website generator. All pages was written in Markdown. This really helps optimizing my time to focus on the detail rather than desperately trying to develop everything from scratch.","My best regards to the developers for such a free-of-charge yet so useful and really easy to use tool."]},{"l":"Indexing structure","p":["You might notice the way I organize the pages - each has its own unique ID number. This method is called Johnny.Decimal. It is a simple yet effective system to keep everything in control."]}],[{"l":"About me","p":["Xin chào! This is Arris. I am a university student based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.","Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I got a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation, so for now, please refer to me by that."]},{"l":"Fields of interest","p":["Currently, I am working towards my bachelor's degree in Computer Science.","Despite being active in one of the most heavily-theoretical field (in my opinion), I have found that I do better on tasks that require a lot of physical practice. And that was basically the main reason why my passion for another field of study was sparked - Robotics.","I have been spending most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. (Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)","I am also working as a spare-time artist under the pseudonym \"K\". You may have seen me as \"K\" or one of my works (in terms of art) somewhere online."]},{"l":"Positive and not-so-positive aspects"},{"l":"What I am capable of","p":["I've had tons of experiences working in groups as the leader and in teams as the team captain. (I am in fact older than almost every student I met so probably because of my age...)","I control my temper very well and perform thoroughly under pressure.","When a new problem arises, I do my research and come up with the solution in a relatively short time."]},{"l":"Something to concern about me","p":["I was diagnosed with ADHD in early 2023 and am actively in professional medical treatment. While overall functioning of my brain has improved since then, I still have to deal with the symptoms at every moment (only they are much easier to control) combining with side effects from my medication. Some of these characteristics are:","Time blindness.","Unable to figure out any detail when looking at multiple different objects/text squeezed in the same small area. This may triggers my anxiety for some time.","Relative to the above: Unable to process if I was forced to listen to multiple sounds from different sources. However, I can distinguish sounds if they come from one source only (such as a recorded audio file).","Extreme dehydration.","Random unintentional pondering sessions."]},{"l":"Technical skills","p":["Programming languages: C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript Communication: Vietnamese, English, Polish, Cantonese Softwares: Autodesk Fusion 360, KiCAD, etc","More details in future updates"]},{"l":"Miscellaneous","p":["Despite my overall image, I am a longtime Hip-hop listener.
