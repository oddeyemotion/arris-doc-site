This [website](https://oddeyemotion.github.io/odd/) was created by [Arris](/contacts.md) (myself) as a personal portfolio to showcase some of my projects related to both Computer Science and Robotics.

> I really hope I could get an internship somewhere in the industry :<

### Site development
The site was generated with [Retype](https://retype.com/) - a text-based static website generator. All pages was written in [Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/getting-started/). This really helps optimizing my time to focus on the detail rather than desperately trying to develop everything from scratch.

My best regards to the developers for such a free-of-charge yet so useful and really easy to use tool.

### Indexing structure
You might notice the way I organize the pages - each has its own unique ID number. This method is called [Johnny.Decimal](https://johnnydecimal.com/10-19-concepts/11-core/11.01-introduction/). It is a simple yet effective system to keep everything in control.
