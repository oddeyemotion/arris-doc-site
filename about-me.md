Xin ch√†o! This is Arris.\
I am a student of Computer Science based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I saw a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation so for now please refer to me by that.

### Fields of study

Despite being a student from (in my opinion) one of the most heavily theoretical major, I found out that I perform better in tasks that require lots of practice.
