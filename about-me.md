# :icon-info: About me

![](/about-me1.jpg)
Xin ch√†o! This is Arris.\
I am a university student based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I got a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation, so for now, please refer to me by that.

### Fields of interest
Currently, I am working towards my bachelor's degree in ***Computer Science***.

Despite being active in one of the most heavily-theoretical field (in my opinion), I have found that I do better on tasks that require a lot of physical practice. And that was basically the main reason why my passion for another field of study was sparked - ***Robotics***.

I have been spending most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. *(Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)*

I am also working as a spare-time artist under the alias "K". You may have seen me as "K" or one of my works (in terms of art) somewhere online.

### Positive and not-so-positive aspects
##### What I am capable of
- I've had tons of experiences working in groups as the leader and in teams as the team captain. *(I am in fact older than almost every student I met so probably because of my age...)*
- I control my temper very well and perform thoroughly under pressure.
- When a new problem arises, I do my research and come up with the solution in a relatively short time.

##### Something to concern about me
I was diagnosed with [ADHD](https://adhdclinic.co.uk/what-is-adhd-introduction/) in early 2023 and am actively in professional medical treatment. While overall functioning of my brain has improved since then, I still have to deal with the symptoms at every moment (only they are much easier to control) combining with side effects from my medication. Some of these characteristics are:
- Time blindness.
- Unable to figure out any detail when looking at multiple different objects/text squeezed in the same small area. This may triggers my anxiety for some time.
- Relative to the above: Unable to process if I was forced to listen to multiple sounds from different sources. However, I can distinguish sounds if they come from one source only (such as a recorded audio file).
- Extreme dehydration.
- Random unintentional pondering sessions.

### Technical skills

Programming languages: ```C/C++, Python, Java, HTML/CSS/Javascript```\
Communication: ```Vietnamese, English, Polish, Cantonese```\
Softwares: ```Autodesk Fusion 360, KiCAD, etc```
