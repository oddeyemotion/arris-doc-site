Xin ch√†o! This is Arris.\
I am a student of Computer Science based in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam.

Clearly Arris is not my real name, but from time to time I saw a lot of people struggling with the pronunciation so for now please refer to me by that.

### Fields of interest

Despite being a student from (in my opinion) one of the most heavily theoretical major, I found out that I perform better in tasks that require lots of physical practice.\
And that, basically, is the main reason for my passion with another field of study - ***robotics***.\
I spent most of my time in university self-teaching everything about robotics. I have participated in some school contests as well, together with friends from different engineering majors. *(Pretty sad that I never got a chance to win any, but I absolutely adore every moment working in groups and having fun with them.)*
