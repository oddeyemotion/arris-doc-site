**MERC**, or *Mechanical Engineering Robot Contest*, is a robotics program hosted by [C.A.T](https://www.facebook.com/CreAcaTechnoCLub) - an academic club of [HCMUT](https://hcmut.edu.vn/tong-quan?lang=en)'s mechanical engineering department, composed of competitors from different universities in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. The event encourages STEM learning and cooperation by hosting competitions between robots in a yearly changed game.

In a typical game, two teams are labeled as different colors and they compete against each other for points. The team that has the most points wins the match.
