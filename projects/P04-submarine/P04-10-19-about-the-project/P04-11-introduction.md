### Why this site?
It seems like we lose a lot of collective knowledge with every undocumented project. This generally limits the success factor of any newly formed team as members spend time relearning concepts and repeating past mistakes. Those who have experience in certain areas have to train novice members and thus robs everyone of their time. Preventing this from happening will help us work more efficiently.

Since this knowledge base was primarily intended for internal use by [Team Submarine](/projects/P04-submarine/P04-10-19-about-the-project/P04-12-team-submarine.md), there might be some sections that do not fit to others. Nevertheless, the vast majority of the content should be applicable to most projects. So, if you'd like to use this as a resource for your study, feel free.

### *Submarine* - Project description
*Submarine* is a hybrid 4WD, Bluetooth-controlled competitive robot car. It is capable of collecting and holding solid game pieces of varying profile while moving across the playing field with desired accuracy and excessively high speed.

The frame is constructed with [T-slotted 2020 aluminum framing rails](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/T-slot_structural_framing) and compatible profile assembling accessories. Our hybrid wheel system consists of two regular 65mm tractor wheels as *drive wheels* and two self-manufactured 65mm Omni wheels at *steering wheels*, which mimics front axle steering mechanism and allows for smooth turns while maintaining friction.

The robot has two Arduino micro-controller boards, one for propulsion control and one for end effector state switching. Each communicates directly with a separate Android device via a paired Bluetooth module connected to its integrated pins. The boards are programmable using the [Arduino IDE](https://www.arduino.cc/en/software).

The project lasts 7 weeks and reached the quarterfinals before being ousted.:sob:
