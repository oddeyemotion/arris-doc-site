### FDM 3D printer

!!!
*More details in future updates*
!!!

A typical FDM 3D printer takes a polymer-based filament and forces it through a heated nozzle, which melts the material and deposits it in 2D layers on the build platform. While still warm, these layers fuse with each other to eventually create a three-dimensional part.

FDM builds parts layer by layer by selectively depositing melted material in a predetermined path. 

Generally accepted as the simplest way to 3D print stuff, FDM is accessible, reasonably efficient, and widely popular. FDM printers dominate the 3D printing market, being remarkably more straightforward than resin 3D printing and massively cheaper than powder-based methods, such as SLS.

For the sake of simplicity, you can use external 3D printing services.
