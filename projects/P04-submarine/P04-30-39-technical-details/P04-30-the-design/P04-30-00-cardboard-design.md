This “cardboard” mockup was created using LEGO® pieces as a basic proof-of-concept for the layout of our mechanisms and used as a reference during the early design stages to get a better idea of how all the mechanisms would fit together in 3D.

A 3D model was recreated in [LeoCAD](https://www.leocad.org/) for easier access. Available on [Github](https://github.com/oddeyemotion/submarine/blob/77ad2979773a8d3cb6605b7fac492596bfe766d3/3D%20files/cardboard.obj).
