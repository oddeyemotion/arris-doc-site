### Drivetrain
A common practice in robotics tournaments is to use pre-built kits of parts or even pre-built frames to minimize the time required, and it would be really advantageous to do so. However, in our current country of residence (Vietnam) we can only find robot car kits that look like this:

These are good for starters and those who want to try small scale projects, but to protect our castle we need something way more bigger.

Our choice of drivetrain is **Hybrid 4WD** - 4-wheel drive consists of 2 different pairs of wheel of different type.



### Manipulator
We want to take advantage on linear forward only motion.

It is capable of reaching x cm of height.

### End effector

Our member, [highzer0](https://github.com/highzer0), has been experiencing on his gripper mechanism before using rack and pinion mechanism as the base.

It can hold different pieces:
