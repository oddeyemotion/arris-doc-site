The gripper is a critical component of the robot car's ability to compete in games. It enables the robot car to pick up and move game pieces, which is the primary method of scoring points.\
Our gripper is controlled by a separated controller board.

### Gripper motion mechanism
Our member, [highzer0](https://github.com/highzer0), has been experiencing on his gripper mechanism before using rack and pinion mechanism as the base.

The rack and pinion mechanism is a type of linear actuator that converts rotational motion into linear motion. It is used in the robot's gripper to open and close the two fingers horizontally.

The rack and pinion mechanism consists of two parts: a pinion and a rack. The pinion is a small gear that rotates, and the rack is a long, flat bar with teeth on it. When the pinion rotates, it meshes with the teeth on the rack, causing the rack to move in a straight line.

The pinion is attached to a motor, and the rack is attached to the two fingers of the gripper. When the motor rotates the pinion, the rack moves, causing the fingers to open or close.

The rack and pinion mechanism is a simple and effective way to open and close the two fingers of the gripper. It is also relatively inexpensive to manufacture.

### Panels
The squishies are made of a soft material that will not damage the game pieces.
