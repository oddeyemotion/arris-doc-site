The visible, physical stuffs as how we call it, *hardware*, is the subject of this segment.

Discussing in depth about our chassis and mechanism specifications, we focused on ensuring that our end result reflected our design intent and was suitable for the game.

### Drivetrain
A common practice in robotics tournaments is to use pre-built kits of parts or even pre-built frames to minimize the time required, and it would be really advantageous to do so. However, in our current country of residence (Vietnam) we can only find robot car kits that look like this:

These are good for starters and those who want to try small scale projects, but to protect our castle we need something way more bigger.

Our choice of drivetrain is **Hybrid 4WD** - 4-wheel drive consists of 2 different pairs of wheel of different type.

### Manipulator
We want to take advantage on linear forward only motion.

It is capable of reaching x cm of height.

### End effector

Our member, [highzer0](https://github.com/highzer0), has been experiencing on his gripper mechanism before using rack and pinion mechanism as the base.

It can hold different pieces:

### Control system

The following segments summarizes some design-relevant materials and their properties.

### Shaped aluminum
Aluminum is non-magnetic, and an excellent electrical and thermal conductor. 

### Plexiglass
Also known as acrylic or mica, plexiglass is widely available as sheets.

### PLA plastic
PLA stands for *Polylactic acid* - a thermoplastic monomer derived from renewable, organic sources such as corn starch or sugar cane. 

### Controller
Arduino Mega 2560

### Actuator
##### Stepper motor
Nema 17

##### Motor driver
TB6600

### Power source
18650 baterries

### Communication
Bluetooth
