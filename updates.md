# :icon-dependabot: Updates

### Current version
The site is still in alpha development phase.

### Acknowledged issues
- *Light theme* interface is not yet synchronized with the *Dark theme*. If *Light theme* is your default, **please locate the moon toggle switch in the top right corner to enable dark mode**.
- The color of headings will not change to white upon initial load (they will appear in pink). Though this does not interfere with other functionalities, it is highly recommended to reload the site once to ensure that the custom CSS script is fully loaded before continuing.
