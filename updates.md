# :icon-dependabot: Updates

### Current version
The site is still in alpha development phase.

### Acknowledged issues
- The color of headings will not change to white upon initial load (they will appear in pink). Though this does not interfere with other functionalities, it is highly recommended to reload the site once to ensure that the custom CSS script is fully loaded before continuing.

- Light theme interface not yet synced with Dark theme.
- Responsive features not fully map to vertical phone screens' dimension.
- Some file names and section ID are wrongly paired or not identical.
- Add-ons and sidebar buttons are disabled when accessing this site in Opera browser.
